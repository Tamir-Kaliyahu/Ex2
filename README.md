# Welcome to our Pokemon Challenge!
## Introduction: 
#### In this Project we had to implement a solution for the pokemon game - more pokemons means greater score!
#### this project has two parts:
implement a directed weighted graph interface by a data structure which we think is the right one, and also to implement a algoriyhms interface to support the common uses for that graph.

use the DS and algoriyhms that we built in the first part to implement a pokemon game : for a given arena (directed weighted graph), agents and pokemons we need to make the agents catch pokemons in order to get the highest score.
## Main purpose:
#### improve two previous assignments, create efficient Algorithm to get the highest possible score.
## How to run:
### cmd:
* Open command line
* get into jar location using: <code> cd * '/'(jar directory) </code>
* write run command:  <code> java -jar Ex2.jar (ID) (Level) </code>
* Game should run untill time runs out!
### Executable:
* Open Ex2.jar (make sure data folder located in the same directory)
* Enter your ID, and your desired level.
* Game should run untill time runs out!
